# FOSSyFiles -- LAN File Transfer App in C/C++

Bored from Big Tech restricting compatibility ?
Bored from shitty features like NearbyShare and Microsoft's damn account logins for transfering a single innocent file ?
Are you regularly beaten to death while switching 5 chrome tabs for sending a single .png through our last hope, google drive ?
Are you a damn teenager who can't afford a NAS ?

We have (will have) a solution to our miseries !

Damn, im not that dramatic, it's just that i had nothing to write in this readme currently --> once comleted, you'll have the comlete descrition of the software uloaded here



Development phase for FOSSyFiles, once completed here, I'll upload it to my projects and codeshowcase locations as well
